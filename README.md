# JAVA CALCULATOR IMPLEMENTATIONS

It is essential to understand the impact of software architecture on quality. These calculators are result of different perspectives. Each student was assigned with the simple task of developing a calculator that receives two values and outputs a result, considering the four basic operations: sum, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

There is no wrong implementation. What we've got was nine calculators emphasing different quality attributes. For instance, the [Calculator 8](./Calc8.java) is the simplest, most likely, it has the highest maintainability. On the other hand, the [Calculator 5](./Calc5.java) uses a GUI, which gives it the highest usability.

This is key when working with software architecture: there is no good or bad architecture. The strategy you use for your architecture depends on the quality attribute you need most!
